# MISUX-Smart-User-followingSuitcase

Misux is a carry-on suitcase adapted with motors, GPS, ultrasonic and Bluetooth
sensors and gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer to determine position of user through an app and
follow them. Able to move at ~ 5 km/h and find the user with a ~2 meters precision. Used obstacle detection
in a 30 cm range and PI controls.

MISUX.ino is the main code while angulo_quaternion handles different functions needed to determine where the suitcase is facing. 
Thorough information about the project and the design desicions can be found in "MALETA_INTELIGENTE_SEGUIDORA_DE_USUARIO.pdf" (In Spanish)

Finished in June 2019
